# WHAT MAKES PEOPLE HAPPY?

The World Happiness Report is a survey of the state of global happiness. The happiness scores (0-10) are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll.

The Dataset contained several variables such as GDP per capita, Family (Social Support), Life Expectancy, etc.

Our goal with this dataset is to understand what are the factors that drive the country happiness as well as find patterns among countries.

The main conclusions of the analysis were:
* Due to the fact that It exists a strong correlation between the Happiness Score and variables such as GDP per capita, Life Expectancy and Social Support, we could say that the richer the country, the happier. Also, the correlation is less strong with Freedom and Corruption.
*
